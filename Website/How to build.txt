===================

You may either host the source control folders under a Sitecore path, or outside the path.

Under Sitecore Path
7	-------------------
8	If hosted under a Sitecore path then all you need to do is ensure the trunk source control folder lines up with the Sitecore website folder. ie: This file should be under the website folder.
9	
10	Outside Sitecore Path
11	---------------------
12	Rename the "deploy.targets.example" file to "deploy.targets" and edit the file to adjust the path specified in the "SitecorePath" property to point to the website folder of an existing Sitecore solution you have. Do this before starting Visual Studio (or reload your project after the change).
13	
14	<SitecorePath>C:\inetpub\Sitecore 6.3.0 rev. 100928\Website</SitecorePath>
15	
16	When you build the required DLLs will be sourced depending on your deploy.targets settings and required files copied to this location automatically after build.
