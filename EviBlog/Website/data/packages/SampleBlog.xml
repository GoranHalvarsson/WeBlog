However, this right does not grant you a license to any of Sitecore's copyrights or patents for anything you might create using such information. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In return, we simply require that you agree: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol type="1"&gt;&lt;li class="normal"&gt;Not to remove any copyright or other notices from the Software. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="normal"&gt;That if you distribute the Software in source or object form, you will include a verbatim copy of this license. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="normal"&gt;That if you distribute derivative works of the Software in source code form you do so only under a license that includes all of the provisions of this License, and if you distribute derivative works of the Software solely in object form you do so only under a license that complies with this License. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="normal"&gt;That if you have modified the Software or created derivative works, and distribute such modifications or derivative works, you will cause the modified files to carry prominent notices so that recipients know that they are not receiving the original Software. Such notices must state: (i) that you have changed the Software; and (ii) the date of any changes. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="normal"&gt;THAT THE SOFTWARE COMES "AS IS", WITH NO WARRANTIES. THIS MEANS NO EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR ANY WARRANTY OF TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.
